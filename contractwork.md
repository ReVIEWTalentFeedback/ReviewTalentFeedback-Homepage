ReVIEW Talent Feedback System is currently seeking bids for a  part time contractor to join our team. We won a competitive  small businesses grant provided by CT Next Higher Education Fund and the University of Connecticut (UConn) Office of the Vice President for Research.

### About ReVIEW Talent Feedback System

ReVIEW Talent Feedback System is a comprehensive talent management platform that is used to improve the feedback supervisors provide employers. 

We have thousands of active users and our systems are deployed in some of the largest Urban school districts in the Northeast. We provide an entire suite of tools. Our most popular are our video based calibration and collegial calibration tools. Many districts deploy ReVIEW as their full talent system as well. 

### Adding Single Sign On

The ultimate goal of the grant is to lay the foundation for becoming Learning Tools Interoperability compliant. We will begin by adding single sign on features. This requires retooling our user authentication and role provisioning. Once we have LTI compliance every learning management and talent management system will be able to offer our services to their existing customer base.

Once we have have updated our basic architecture (not a small once, we have work to do) we will be adding oAuth integration, either natively or through a third party vendor. 

### Find Your Passion with Us

Beyond the user authentication work we also have pathways for you to explore your own personal growth goals. This position is a good fit for someone who has experience working with MongoDB, Ruby on Rails, and/or Javascript. We are rethinking our method of user authentication, role provisioning, and bulk user uploads. If you have a passion for databases prior experience in any system, library, or language will help as well. Passion always beats skills. Especially when talking validations and databases.

You may also be someone skilled at javascript and jQuery. We have a form builder tool very similar to other form makers. We are going to be creating APIs for each type of our form component and then these APIs will be available for our report builder to call. Based on the type of data: numerical, ordinal, percentage, a data visualization component will be added. If you like turning data into pretty pictures on the front end or have a love statistical modeling you can build a nice sandbox.

We have also notice our customers rightfully turning more to reflective portfolio practices rather than simply numerical measures of teacher effectiveness. Therefore we will also be exploring adding the FrancisCMS Ruby blogging. Each existing district would be given a dedicated bucket and each user provided a subdomain. We would utilize the single sign on system we are creating. So if you have a passion for improving education through reflective blogging and alternatives assessment we could play and hack together on this project as well.

### Who you will work with

Greg McVerry runs the show as the product manager. Ambesh Kumar provides our lead development work on a contract basis. Patrick Flynn leads up sales efforts. We contract with Amy Tepper to provide our professional development solutions. Elissa Berger and Jen McVerry provide support behind the scene as our logistical contractors.

The grant also has money to hire an undergraduate or graduate student worker. This person will work directly with you and Ambesh. After starting the project and determining your needs you will help us to determine the best candidate to support your work.

### How You Will Work

The we we are set up is nobody is really anybody's boss. Greg steers the ship but he's not going to tell the engineer how to keep everything running. Ambesh is looking for someone to run ideas by and institute a peer review before each commit. The best ideas can never come from one person. Ever. 

We pretty much work through Google Apps, Slack and Trello though Greg is always pushing us to move this more on to company properties so capturing our work openly becomes the best kind of content marketing. Reflection and truth sell.

You will mantain the rights to any code you write for us and can assign any license to that code as long as it provides us a royalty free license to use and resell the code, any of our partners to sell our platform including your code, and for our end users to be able to use the stuff you make. 

### Reach Out

If you are an independent contractor or co-op and would like to reach out to discuss a potential partnership please email greg@reviewtalentfeedback and provide a few examples of what you have done (no resumes please). 

We prefer to negotiate a per project fee or a daily rate rather than an hourly rate. We feel this protects both you and us. Of course reality on the ground, or bugs in the code, can require an additional conversation. 

So if ReVIEW sounds like a fun project please drop us a line.
