## Learn Something New as you Build with ReVIEW Talent Feedback System

ReVIEW is a online rubric system that improves student outcomes by focusing on the feedback teachers deliver.

This summer we are adding Single Sign On with OAuth and API endpoints to all our data structures. This will work in conjuction with a new course builder feature.

## Course Builder
As part of this upgrade we are launching a course builder template based on these HTML templates: https://glitch.com/@jgmac1106/indie-web-learning-networks

We will use Kirby, this is a PHP templating engine. Kirby stores data in .txt files reducing the database overhead  but still serves up dynamic content so it is more powerful than a static site generator.

You will also be adding a credentialing platform that includes webmention badges.

## Our Development Philosophy
Writing code is a one time cost. Maintaining it drains you over a lifetime. Both in physical and financial cost. The simpler your data storage system the better your chance of survival.

Simple solutions also lead to sustainable projects. The resiliency of HTML/CSS (and a splash of JavaScript) have lower energy costs and far greater resiliency than many front end frameworks. The world benefits from human readable source code.


## Goals

    - Course building CMS
    - Native webmention support (open source tools)
    - HTML/Microformats/JSON Parser (open source tools)
    - Digital credential platform using webmention badges (its just a blog post and two permalinks..that's the beauty)
    - IndieAuth integration
    - Micropub support


## Qualifications

### HTML and CSS

I am learning CSS Grid now. ReVIEW uses a bootstrap template (for now...and doesn't serve HTML client side....grrrrr) but the Kirby course templates will be built in HTML and PHP. We will use CSS Grid.

### PHP

You do not need to know PHP. If you are more familiar with other languages such at Python, Elixir, Go, node.js or even javascript you will be fine. The Kirby documentation is a wonderful learning tool.

Learning PHP is a good set of skills. So many of my friends finish their programs and then their first job is rebuilding some ancient  ecommerce site. As Automattic switches to REACT there will be massive opportunities (WordPress is 30% of the web) for developers who work with both languages.

### Coding and Learning Together

I will be learning PHP this summer right beside you and want someone who will thrive in a supportive yet unshaped environment.

I don't develop in sprints. The hare loses the race. Instead we will work together to set personal learning goals and development targets.

### VUE.JS

Kirby's portal (publishing UI) is built on VUE.JS. I prefer to publish using a text editor and you do not need any VUE.JS skills to build new UI templates in Kirby. Yet if you have those skills or want to learn VUE.JS this may be a good opportunity.

### Payment

This summer position is grant funded and as  such governed by State policies. Remuneration  is for 100 hours at $20 an hour.

This does not reflect the market rate for development work, even for students. Therefore as further compensation you will own all the code developed as part of the project. You may choose to openly license (encouraged) or keep it proprietary. You just provide ReVIEW Talent Feedback System a non-exclusive royalty free license for life. University of Connecticut and CSU get an exclusive non commercial royalty free license (actual legal language will be in contract )
